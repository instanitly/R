# R Learning Materials

## Overview
This repository contains learning materials and exercises for learning the R programming language, a powerful tool for statistical analysis, data science, and visualization.

## Contents

### Learning Scripts
- **intro_to_R.R**: A comprehensive introduction to R programming covering basic operations, data structures, control structures, functions, and more.
- **data_analysis_practice.R**: Practical examples of data analysis using R's built-in datasets.
- **exercise_solutions.R**: Solutions to the exercises from the intro script (try the exercises yourself first!).
- **loop.R**: Example script demonstrating various uses of single for loops.
- **nested_loop.R**: Example script demonstrating nested for loops for more complex iterations.

### Setup & Reference
- **R_setup_guide.md**: Instructions for setting up your R environment and additional learning resources.

## Getting Started

1. Follow the instructions in **R_setup_guide.md** to install R and RStudio.
2. Open and work through the **intro_to_R.R** script to learn the basics.
3. Practice data analysis with the **data_analysis_practice.R** script.
4. Try solving the exercises in the scripts before checking the solutions.

## Learning Path

This repository is organized to provide a structured learning path:

1. **Basic R Programming** - Variables, data types, data structures, and basic operations
2. **Control Structures** - Conditional statements, loops, and flow control
3. **Functions** - Using built-in functions and creating your own
4. **Data Analysis** - Exploratory data analysis, statistics, and visualization
5. **Advanced Topics** - Data manipulation with packages like dplyr and visualization with ggplot2
